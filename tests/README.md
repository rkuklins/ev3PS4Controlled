# EV3 PS4 Controlled Robot - Test Suite

A comprehensive unit test suite for the EV3 PS4 Controlled Robot project, designed to work with both desktop development environments and EV3 MicroPython.

## Mock Framework

The test suite uses a comprehensive mock framework that simulates EV3 hardware:

### MockMotor Features
- Speed and rotation tracking (`_speed`, `_angle`, `_running`)
- Method simulation (`run()`, `stop()`, `run_target()`, `reset_angle()`)
- State persistence across test calls
- Exception handling simulation

### MockSensor Features
- Simulated sensor readings
- Port assignment tracking
- Configurable return values for testing various scenarios

### Global Module Mocking
The `conftest.py` automatically mocks all pybricks modules:
- `pybricks.ev3devices` (Motor, sensors)
- `pybricks.parameters` (Port, Stop, Direction)
- `pybricks.tools` (wait function)
- `pybricks.hubs` (EV3Brick with speaker)

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Install the required test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Command Line Options

#### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# Using the modern pytest runner (includes coverage)
python3 tests/run_pytest.py

# Direct pytest (basic)
python3 -m pytest tests/ --verbose
```

#### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
# Using the runner
python3 tests/run_pytest.py test_turret

# Direct pytest
python3 -m pytest tests/test_turret.py --verbose
```

#### Run with File Watching (Development)
```bash
python3 tests/run_pytest.py --watch
```

#### Run with Coverage Only
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html:htmlcov --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Coverage Reports

The test runner generates comprehensive coverage reports:

- **Terminal Output**: Shows line-by-line coverage during test run
- **HTML Report**: Detailed coverage report at `htmlcov/index.html`
- **XML Report**: Machine-readable coverage data for CI/CD

Coverage excludes test files, mock files, and external dependencies as configured in `pytest.ini`.

## Test Configuration

### pytest.ini
- Test discovery patterns
- Coverage configuration  
- Output formatting
- Warning filters
- Minimum coverage thresholds (85%)

### requirements-test.txt
- `pytest>=7.0.0` - Modern testing framework
- `pytest-cov>=4.0.0` - Coverage reporting
- `pytest-mock>=3.10.0` - Enhanced mocking capabilities
- `pytest-xdist>=3.0.0` - Parallel test execution

## Benefits

### Development Efficiency
- **Fast Execution**: Desktop testing without EV3 hardware transfer
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 90+ tests covering all major functionality
- **Immediate Feedback**: Tests complete in under 0.1 seconds
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work without hardware conflicts

### Code Quality Assurance
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes before deployment
- **Interface Validation**: Ensure abstract base classes are properly implemented
- **Edge Case Testing**: Validate error handling and boundary conditions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications

### CI/CD Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every commit
- **Coverage Tracking**: Monitor test coverage over time  
- **Cross-Platform**: Tests work on any system with Python
- **Dependency Validation**: Verify compatibility with different environments

## Advanced Features

### Parameterized Tests
Many tests use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for efficient multi-value testing:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x_axis,expected_speed", [
    (60, 216),    # 60% of 360 = 216°/s
    (-80, -288),  # -80% of 360 = -288°/s  
    (100, 360),   # 100% of 360 = 360°/s (max)
    (-100, -360), # -100% of 360 = -360°/s (max)
])
def test_speed_control_movement_outside_deadzone(self, x_axis, expected_speed):
    self.turret.speed_control(x_axis, 0)
    assert self.mock_motor._speed == expected_speed
    assert self.mock_motor._running == True
```

### Fixture Management
Shared fixtures provide consistent test environments:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def device_manager_with_motors(device_manager):
    """Provide a DeviceManager with mock motors already set up"""
    left_motor = MockMotor(MockPort.A)
    right_motor = MockMotor(MockPort.D)
    
    device_manager.devices["drive_L_motor"] = left_motor
    device_manager.devices["drive_R_motor"] = right_motor
    device_manager.available_devices.extend(["drive_L_motor", "drive_R_motor"])
    
    return device_manager, left_motor, right_motor
```

### Error Simulation
Tests validate graceful error handling:

```python
def test_try_init_device_failure(self):
    """Test device initialization failure"""
    class FailingDevice:
        def __init__(self, port):
            raise Exception("Device not found")
    
    device = self.device_manager.try_init_device(FailingDevice, MockPort.A, "failing_device")
    
    assert device is None
    assert self.device_manager.devices["failing_device"] is None
    assert "failing_device" not in self.device_manager.available_devices
    assert "failing_device" in self.device_manager.missing_devices
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Testing
Run tests before committing changes:
```bash
python3 tests/run_pytest.py && git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### IDE Integration
Most modern IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) can automatically discover and run pytest tests with full debugging support.

### Continuous Integration
The test suite is designed for easy CI/CD integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    python3 tests/run_pytest.py
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality to the robot control system:

1. **Create test file**: Follow naming pattern `test_<module_name>.py`
2. **Use fixtures**: Leverage existing fixtures for device setup
3. **Mock dependencies**: Add new mock classes to `mock_ev3_devices.py` if needed
4. **Test edge cases**: Include error conditions and boundary value testing
5. **Update documentation**: Add test descriptions to this README

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the EV3 PS4 Controlled Robot maintains high code quality and reliability throughout development.
